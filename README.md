# 4-Bit Ripple Carry Adder
This project implements a 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder (RCA) using digital logic design principles. A ripple carry adder performs binary addition by cascading full adders, where each bit addition waits for the carry from the previous stageâ€”hence the name "ripple."

# Features:
Designed using basic logic gates (AND, OR, XOR)

Built with 4 full adder modules connected in series

Accepts two 4-bit binary numbers and a carry-in

Produces a 4-bit sum and a carry-out



# Simulation:
Tested using [ModelSim/Xilinx Vivado/other] for functional verification.
